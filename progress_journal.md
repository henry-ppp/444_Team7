# Team 7 Progress Journal - Rough Draft

## Team Meeting Notes

### Meeting 1 - January 20th

- We will firstly work towards the literature review from part 1 of the project
- We have 4 weeks of work until this is due
- For next week, each team member must:
  - Read 2 or more recent research paper on Single object tracking task, at least on of which should be using traditional computer vision method (that means it is not using deep leaning approach)
  - Prepare a quick report or summary of the research to discuss in next meeting
  - Learn about pytorch if they do not have previous background
- Each team member should have a good understanding of the foundations of their papers, so that in the next meeting we can each share to get a better understanding of single object tracking techniques
- After next week, we should aim to hone our literature review efforts into the papers that will help us define our problem statement for part 2 of the project
