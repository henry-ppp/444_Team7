# Team 7 Progress Journal - Rough Draft

## Team Meeting Notes

### Meeting 1 - January 20th

- We will firstly work towards the literature review from part 1 of the project
- We have 4 weeks of work until this is due
- **For next week**, each team member must:
  - Read 2 or more recent research paper on Single object tracking task, at least one of which should be using traditional computer vision methods (that means it is not using deep leaning approach)
  - Prepare a quick report or summary of the research to discuss in next meeting
    - Each team member should have a good understanding of the foundations of their papers, so that we can share with each other to get a better understanding of single object tracking techniques
  - Learn about pytorch if they do not have previous background knowledge
- **In next week's meeting**, we should:
  - Share our findings
  - Aim to hone our literature review efforts into the papers that will help us define our problem statement for part 2 of the project
  - Put together a Kanban or progress board where we can track to-dos. This will help with the development in the repo for part 2
