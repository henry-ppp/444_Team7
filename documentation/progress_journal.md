# Team 7 Progress Journal - Rough Draft

## Team Meeting Notes

### Meeting 1 - January 20th

- We will firstly work towards the literature review from part 1 of the project
- We have 4 weeks of work until this is due
- **For next week**, each team member must:
  - Read 2 or more recent research paper on Single object tracking task, at least one of which should be using traditional computer vision methods (that means it is not using deep leaning approach)
  - Prepare a quick report or summary of the research to discuss in next meeting
    - Each team member should have a good understanding of the foundations of their papers, so that we can share with each other to get a better understanding of single object tracking techniques
  - Learn about pytorch if they do not have previous background knowledge
- **In next week's meeting**, we should:
  - Share our findings
  - Aim to hone our literature review efforts into the papers that will help us define our problem statement for part 2 of the project
  - Put together a Kanban or progress board where we can track to-dos. This will help with the development in the repo for part 2

### Meeting 2 - January 27th

- Literature review is due in 3 weeks
- Discussion on our research papers:
  - There are many SOT techniques still being researched to address issues with variations in occlusion, lighting (poor conditions or rapid changes) scale, pose, and deformations.
  - Many traditional correlation filters have been used to address these issues, yet they still fall short in many scenarios
    - We should to try to borrow various different advancements that build upon this technique to build our own for a specific task
    - Which task will we focus on?
  - Emerging deep learning models can address these challenges and more:
    - We should aim to reduce computation complexity of the model to increase efficiency so that it can be used on-device in more applications
    - We could build a pipeline to combine traditional methods (e.g. correlation filters) with these newer learning methods. Is this still considered a traditional method to prof?
- **For next week**, each team member must:
  - ?
- **In next week's meeting**, we should:
  - ?
